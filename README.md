# Ambient Design Legion


## What is Ambient Code Platform?

Ambient is a way to amplify your impact, scaling effort non-linearly to create more and deeper solutions in less time than it would take a human user to do this work serially. It is a flexible platform to enable and  develop new ways of working. Specifically it is...

* a cluster for hosting multiple, simultaneous agent sessions.
* a workflow engine for fine-grained controls over context, skills, commands, etc.
* a nexus for data stored in internal systems (ex. UX Research Agent, product telemetry)
* an agent-assisted interface for multiple hosted 3rd-party systems (ex. Miro, Slack, Jira, Google Docs)
* a way to leverage AI-native tools as they develop (Beads, Apollo, Cursor agent, MCP resources etc.)

## How Can Ambient amplify the impact of design?

— Generate synthetic mood boards, user journey maps, and other cognitive artifacts based on context sources
— Generate or update entire synthetic design systems based on context sources
— Generate relevant, specific creative solutions and proposals on-demand
— Prototype new features for existing products on demand
— Synthesize dynamic interfaces built on demand that react to user needs 
— Improve the quality (usability, accessibility, emotional impact) of a user experience
— Continual improvement of UX through ongoing analysis and UX bug fixes
— “Design linting” for checking work against similar patterns, views, user-flows, etc. in an existing user interface as well as pre-defined standards and design systems
— Automate toil associated with the design process, (ex. Associating new design work to project tracking in Jira or other task management system)
