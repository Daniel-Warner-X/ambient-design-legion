# Ambient Design Legion

## Mood Board Application

A web-based mood board tool for curating design inspiration with color palettes, images, and typography.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser.

### Features

- **Color Palette Builder**: Use the eyedropper to pick colors from anywhere on the page (max 5)
- **Image Management**: Auto-loads images from the `mood/` folder
- **Typography Samples**: Preview different font families with sample text
- **Import/Export**: Save and restore your curated selections as JSON
- **Customizable**: Adjust spacing, background colors, and text colors

### Adding Images

Simply drop image files into the `mood/` folder and refresh the page. The server automatically discovers new images.

## What is Ambient Code Platform?

Ambient is a way to amplify your impact, scaling effort non-linearly to create more and deeper solutions in less time than it would take a human user to do this work serially. It is a flexible platform to enable and  develop new ways of working. Specifically it is...

* a cluster for hosting multiple, simultaneous agent sessions.
* a workflow engine for fine-grained controls over context, skills, commands, etc.
* a nexus for data stored in internal systems (ex. UX Research Agent, product telemetry)
* an agent-assisted interface for multiple hosted 3rd-party systems (ex. Miro, Slack, Jira, Google Docs)
* a way to leverage AI-native tools as they develop (Beads, Apollo, Cursor agent, MCP resources etc.)

## How Can Ambient amplify the impact of design?

* Generate synthetic mood boards, user journey maps, and other cognitive artifacts based on context sources
* Generate or update entire synthetic design systems based on context sources
* Generate relevant, specific creative solutions and proposals on-demand
* Prototype new features for existing products on demand
* Synthesize dynamic interfaces built on demand that react to user needs
* Improve the quality (usability, accessibility, emotional impact) of a user experience
* Continual improvement of UX through ongoing analysis and UX bug fixes
* “Design linting” for checking work against similar patterns, views, user-flows, etc. in an existing user interface as well as pre-defined standards and design systems
* Automate toil associated with the design process, (ex. Associating new design work to project tracking in Jira or other task management system) 

## What is Ambient Design Legion

A set of evolving agent personas that participate in design tasks.

## What Agent Roles Currently Exist

### Core Design Agents

**Creative Director**
Provides high-level creative vision and strategic direction across design initiatives. Synthesizes inputs from other agents, resolves conflicting approaches, and ensures design outputs align with brand identity and business goals.

**UX Researcher**
Synthesizes user research data, conducts heuristic evaluations, and generates insights from user feedback, interviews, and behavioral analytics. Specializes in identifying usability issues and user needs.

**Visual Designer**
Creates and iterates on visual design concepts, mood boards, and aesthetic explorations. Evaluates designs against brand guidelines, accessibility standards, and visual hierarchy principles.

**Interaction Designer**
Focuses on user flows, micro-interactions, and behavioral patterns. Designs intuitive navigation systems and ensures consistency across interaction paradigms.

**Design System Curator**
Maintains and evolves component libraries and design tokens. Ensures design system coherence, identifies gaps, and proposes new patterns based on emerging needs.

**Accessibility Advocate**
Audits designs for WCAG compliance, identifies accessibility barriers, and proposes inclusive design alternatives. Champions universal design principles.

### Specialized Agents

**Prototyper**
Rapidly generates functional prototypes from design specifications. Translates static designs into interactive experiences for validation and testing.

**Design Critic**
Provides structured critique and feedback on design work. Evaluates proposals against established heuristics, user research, and business objectives.

**Pattern Scout**
Analyzes existing products and interfaces to identify reusable patterns, inconsistencies, and opportunities for consolidation or improvement.

**Copy & Content Designer**
Crafts UI copy, microcopy, and content strategy. Ensures voice consistency and clarity across user-facing text.

**Design Ops Coordinator**
Manages design workflow automation, asset organization, and integration with project tracking systems. Reduces operational toil in the design process.
